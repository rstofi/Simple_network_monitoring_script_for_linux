-------------

My router was very bad in my new apartment, so write some scripts to monitpor my wifi performance and the network properties, to support my claim for a new router.....

This repo contains the bash and Python based scripts for monitor wifi signal strenght, traffic and speed using Linux specific library /proc/net/ and plotting the results. Altough there are existing softwares I wrote the code from scratch, however I had only a day or so to do it so be careful with using the codes!
